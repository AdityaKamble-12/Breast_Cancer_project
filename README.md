# Breast_Cancer_project
This project is a complete machine learning solution for classifying breast tumors as either malignant or benign. It uses a Random Forest model that achieved 96% accuracy and a near-perfect ROC-AUC score of 0.99. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook that documents the entire process, from exploring the data to training the models.
